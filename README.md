To Understand this repository Please read "READMe.md" file.
this is eclipse Java Project Structure,so Java files are in src folder.<br>

In this repository, I have posted task-4 that I completed during my internship at "CodSoft".  <br>

I have completed Internship 'Task 4', which involves creating a "ATM Interface". I have now posted it in the repository <br>
I have made Command line Menu Driven ATM Interface using Core Java concepts.
there are 3 files, but if you have to run it you have to run 'ATM.java' file. <br>
file name = Transaction.java    <br>
file name = BankAccount.java    <br>
main method file name = ATM.java    <br>
